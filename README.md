# Professional development plan report

For completing professional development plan, it was decided to implement the project which covers main personal professional experience goals.

First thing first let‚Äôs discuss the project and involved technologies which were used throughout the development. 
The project is basically a network of communities where people can exchange their ideas, news and discuss different stuff.

## To develop such an application the following technologies were used:
 - Next.js for convenient fullstack development, which is known as a framework based on React.js. 
 - Next Auth was chosen according to the framework‚Äôs ecosystem.
 - Tailwind CSS for convenient styling
 - UploadThing for image cashing
 - Aiven and Prisma for building scalable and manageable database
 - Redis for vote and post caching 
 - And more.

## Features üöÄ
- Authentication using NextAuth & Google
- Custom feed for authenticated users
- Data fetching using React-Query
- A highly functional post editor
- Image uploads & link previews
- Full comment functionality
- ... and much more

By utilizing these technologies I significantly improved my comprehension according to the goals.

## Goal 1 ‚úîÔ∏è
For the first goal it was used Next.js generally for creating app and complex state management, Editor.js for complex form with zod validation. Additionally there is attached a Vue.js project with similar achievements. [vue pet project - https://github.com/frntprog/WhatsApp]
## Goal 2 ‚úîÔ∏è
Developing different aspects of the app helped me significantly improve my knowledge regarding asynchronous JavaScript by using async / await feature and understanding how promises are working. That‚Äôs why goal 2 might be considered as achieved.
## Goal 3 ‚úîÔ∏è
Understanding a complete lifecycle of DOM is crucial for web developing. Also it is important to understand such principles as event propagation and population. That‚Äôs why I covered some articles and followed it‚Äôs principles during implementation. Hence, goal 3 is achieved.
## Goal 4 ‚úîÔ∏è
For undertanding web workers and service workers as well as push API I considered following articles:

- https://medium.com/naukri-engineering/introduction-to-web-workers-3dc8c7dce0be
- https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/
## Goal 5 ‚úîÔ∏è
And finally I covered TypeScript by utilizing its best practices, different features as interfaces, classes and types. That‚Äôs why this goal is achieved.
